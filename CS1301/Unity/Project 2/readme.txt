Project: Game 2

This is a fun little game I made up for the project. I really wanted to build off what I did last time, 
but wanted it to be distinct. It's stretching the requirements a little, but I tried to meet them, even
if it was a little loose. That's why the garage structure is set up, in some ways, like a maze. The other 
player is your destination, and while the enemies themselves aren't necessarily the hazards, the projectiles
they fire are (Bumping into a tank IRL wouldn't do as much damage as one shooting you would). 

The features I didn't get to add were a death feature, more audio, and a menu. I wanted the game to load into
a menu that let you decide whether you wanted the single-player maze, a single-player tank game, or the 
multi-player tank game. At that time, I didn't know exactly how I wanted the multi-player one to work, but I
would've made it to where one of the players could be removed without requiring too many scripting changes. I 
didn't include the audio because I didn't have the time to find good free ones. Also, for the death effect,
I was thinking of creating an explosion particle, or changing the tank color to a darker material, but I didn't
have time to look at those either.

Anyways, this was a ton of fun to make. I hope you enjoy! :D
